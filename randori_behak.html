          <h1>Operation Randori Behak</h1>

          <p>
            One of the Indian Armyâ€™s most successful counter-terror strikes was
            Operation Randori Behak which began on April 1, 2020. It was three
            days before special forces commandos were called in to flush out the
            terrorists hiding in Kupwara. Soldiers deployed in the battalion
            manning the defences of Kupwara repeatedly picked up and lost track
            of the terrorists as they infiltrated across the Line of Control
            (LOC).
          </p>
          <p>
            The troops began to trail the terrorists at 4:30 PM on April 3,
            2020, and did so again at 6:30 PM on April 4. Then Subedar Sanjiv
            Kumar, Havildar Devendra Singh, Paratrooper Chhatrapal Singh,
            Paratrooper Bal Krishnan and Paratrooper Amit Kumar of 4th
            Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, (Special Forces) were deployed in
            to flush out the terrorists and finish the operation as soon as
            possible. On April 5, around dawn, while tracking the terrorists,
            the five commandos of 4 Parachute ventured onto cornice, an
            overhanging patch of hardened snow with no underlying support.
          </p>
          <p>
            A fierce gun battle broke out between the soldiers and the
            terrorists at an extremely close quarters. The other two soldiers
            who hastened to the scene of the fighting after spotting their
            companions under heavy fire. In the ensuing heavy exchange of fire,
            the para commandos led by Subedar Sanjeev Kumar managed to eliminate
            all the five terrorists.
